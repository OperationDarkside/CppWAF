# CppWAF
## C++ Web Application Framework

A framework for building web applications with web components in C++

This framework uses C++ with CTAS on the server-side and vanilla JavaScript on the client-side.

## Goals
- User code is written in pure modern C++
- The user-created component DOM will be rendered on the client-side by the framework
- The server's C++ and the client's JavaScript code will try to synchronize the component DOM's state
